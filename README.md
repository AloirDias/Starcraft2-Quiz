Assignment Title: Interactive JavaScript Quiz
For this assignment you are to build an interactive quiz on a topic of your choice using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The quiz should contain the following:
•	An introduction 

•	The quiz itself

•	Feedback

The introduction should ask for the user’s name. This should be used later in the feedback. They should then press a “start button” to start the quiz.

The quiz should feature 5 questions, chosen randomly from a bank of 10+ questions. When you play the quiz again, the questions/order would be different.

At least one question should use radio buttons to answer (multiple choice)
At least one question should use text input to answer.
At least one question should feature 3-4 photos and the user clicks the correct photo to answer correctly.

Only one question should appear on screen at a time. You should offer “next” or “prev/next” buttons or have it when you answer one question, it moves on to the next. There should always be a header on screen.

When all questions have been completed, the quiz should show the user their score, as a percentage, and a message. E.g. “Well done, you got 100%, Ruairí” 

Further requirements:
The quiz should appear on one page called index.html.

Each question should have a question number and a title with the full question displayed underneath.

Make sure the user has filled in the necessary fields and warn them if they do not.   

Validate all answers, for example if a textbox question requires an answer “3”, then “3” or “three” should give a correct answer but not “33”.

The footer of your webpage should contain your name, student id and email address, eg Quiz by: John Smith, 2989877, john@griffith.ie

This must be built using JavaScript, without libraries.

All work most be your own.

HTML and CSS should be validated by an online validator.

Marks will be awarded for:
Working code (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)
Good practice
Comments
Usability

Deliverables:
Use one HTML file (called index.html) and include this along with all other
files (your own JavaScript and CSS files) in a folder
named "yourname_studentnumber_js" and zip it up and upload to Moodle.

Learning Outcomes Being Assessed:
Demonstrate an advanced knowledge of client-side web standards
technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
